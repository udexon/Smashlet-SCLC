Smashlet Cloudless Computing (SCLC): The Next Big Thing since Linux and the World Wide Web

Smashlet is an amalgamation of the words stack machine, shell, and servlet.

Smashlet is a generalization of Forth programs, where words (Forth-like words) in reverse Polish notation are mapped to functions in high level ("third generation") host programming languages, whereas in conventional Forth, words are mapped directly to assembly instructions.

The original motivation of developing smashlet was to make it possible to develop programs on mobile devices itself. Although GNU Forth is available on Android, smashlet can access all function libraries in the host programming languages, such as PHP, JavaScript, Java, Python etc.

Smashlet can also be used to introduce the reverse Polish notation as a universal script that interfaces to all known programming languages.

Two years have passed since July 2019, when the prototype of smashlet was created, and time has proven that the above are insufficient as selling points to attract adopters.

Now we shall introduce AndServer Smashlet, a Java http Servlet framework running on Android. With AndServer, one may avoid the need to install UserLand or GNUroot on Android devices to run web server in Linux, whose work I greatly recommend and admire by the way. 

In short, AndServer Smashlet is a full stack (front end plus back end) solution that can be run on billions of mobile devices, with direct access to thousands of Java libraries in use for decades. 

Such is the great length one needs to go in order to attract followers nowadays, compared to the early days of Linux and the World Wide Web, which I believe the Next Big Thing like these predecessors Smashlet can become.

Smashlet will usher in the era of Cloudless Computing, where cloud computing will become a thing of the past.
