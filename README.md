# Smashlet-SCLC
Smashlet Cloudless Computing (SCLC): The Next Big Thing since Linux and the World Wide Web (Hopefully!!)


Smashlet is an amalgamation of the words stack machine, shell, and servlet.

Smashlet is a generalization of Forth programs, where words (Forth-like words) in reverse Polish notation are mapped to functions in high level ("third generation") host programming languages, whereas in conventional Forth, words are mapped directly to assembly instructions.

The original motivation of developing smashlet was to make it possible to develop programs on mobile devices itself. Although GNU Forth is available on Android, smashlet can access all function libraries in the host programming languages, such as PHP, JavaScript, Java, Python etc.

Smashlet can also be used to introduce the reverse Polish notation as a universal script that interfaces to all known programming languages.

Two years have passed since July 2019, when the prototype of smashlet was created, and time has proven that the above are insufficient as selling points to attract adopters.

Now we shall introduce AndServer Smashlet, a Java http Servlet framework running on Android. With AndServer, one may avoid the need to install UserLand or GNUroot on Android devices to run web server in Linux, whose work I greatly recommend and admire by the way. 

In short, AndServer Smashlet is a full stack (front end plus back end) solution that can be run on billions of mobile devices, with direct access to thousands of Java libraries in use for decades.

Such is the great length one needs to go in order to attract followers nowadays, compared to the early days of Linux and the World Wide Web, which I believe the Next Big Thing like these predecessors Smashlet can become.

Smashlet will usher in the era of Cloudless Computing, where cloud computing will become a thing of the past.

As industry "influencers" get excited about coining the next buzzwords, our definition of Cloudless Computing has its roots in Anarchism, or a gentler Taoist face in the form of 无为 Wuwei, literally Goalless. 

(For a recent popular introduction to Toaist political ideologies, the frest out of the oven Chinese drama 长安十二时辰 Changan 24 Hours would be a good start, which depicts Li Bi, a historical Taoist priest, who was to not just solve the 24 hour crisis in the drama, but eventually to become a prime minister to help the great Tang dynasty recover from its biggest crisis, and laid the foundation of a new taxation system for China, in continuous use until the modern era.)

More specifically, Smashlet will enable messaging using public key cryptography, a concept whose significance is poorly understood perhaps due to lack of practical implementations.

The most popular implementations of public key cryptography to date are perhaps browser TLS and cryptocurrencies. However, the public keys used by these systems are managed in a centralized manner.

Smashlet would allow ad-hoc generation and deployment of public keys, thus making them untraceable and truly anonymous. This will become the foundation of the true Cloudless computing.
